This dashboard allows you to query and visualize data that the Wesnoth organization collects about multiplayer games played on the official server.

1. Begin by selecting a date range. Once you have selected a date range, the database is queried and the results are displayed in the figures.
2. You can hover over the figures to see more information about the data points. On a touch screen, the equivalent of hovering is to tap and hold.
3. When you hover over a figure, you will see a toolbar in its top right corner. You can use this toolbar to zoom in, zoom out, pan, autoscale, and reset the axes. More information about the toolbar can be found [here](https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/).
